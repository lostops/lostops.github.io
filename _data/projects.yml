# Implementing VMware virtualisation and migration of native systems
- project: Implementing VMware and migration of physical servers
  role: Project owner and project engineer
  duration: 2008 &mdash; Present

  description: Starting with VMware Infrastructure 3.5 back in 2009 until today with VMware vSphere 6.5, virtualisation is the foundation of the modern datacenter. In this project the target was to replace all physical servers with virtual machines to obtain more flexibility and increased availability by reducing physical space at the same time. The VMware cluster was implemendet on HP Procurve DL360 servers. Starting with Gen. 5 systems back in the day and running on Gen. 9 systems until today. The project involved not only the setup of VMware but also the configuration of vSwitches with VLANs and the setup of NFS datasores and the performance optimisation of the whole environment. During the years we succeeded to replace ten physical racks with two racks of VMware virtualisation nodes.

  description: In parallel to the implementation of virtualisation with VMware, a storage was needed to provide shared storage capacity for the VMware nodes. After testing products of several different manufacturers (EqualLogic, EMC and NetApp) we decided to go with a NetApp FAS system. In this project the FAS was prepared as a fully redundant multi protocol filer (CIFS, NFS, iSCSI) to consolidate a bunch of distributed DAS systems (mostly EasyRaid and HP MSA). The FAS was integrated into Active Directory and replaced a classic CIFS filer while at the same time served NFS datastores for VMware and iSCSI block storage for machines that required so. Throughout the years the FAS was extended with more disk capacity (shelfs) and tuned with SSD storage to fit IOPS intensive workloads.
